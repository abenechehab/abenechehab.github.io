Hey, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

I am Abdelhakim Benechehab, a third-year Ph.D. student at Huawei Noahâ€™s Ark Lab and <a href='https://www.eurecom.fr/en/research/department-data-science'>EURECOM</a> working on Reinforcement Learning and Foundation Models. I am jointly supervised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=khT6tDsAAAAJ&hl=en">Giuseppe Paolo</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ILUeAloAAAAJ&hl=en">Maurizio Filippone</a>.

In my research, I explore methods to improve dynamics models in the context of model-based reinforcement learning. This includes developing models suitable for long-horizon planning, and that are aware of their errors through uncertainty estimation. Additionally, I am interested in foundation models, particularly their applications in reinforcement learning, dynamics modeling and time series forecasting.

Previously, I earned my masterâ€™s degree at <a href="https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/">ENS Paris-Saclay</a> in 2021 from the Mathematics, Vision, and Machine Learning (<a href="https://www.master-mva.com/">MVA</a>) program. I also hold an engineering degree from <a href="https://www.mines-stetienne.fr/en/">Ã‰cole des Mines de Saint-Ã‰tienne</a> in mathematics and computer science.

Besides my Ph.D. work, I was a member of the Moroccan NGO <a href='https://www.mathmaroc.org/'>Math&Maroc</a>, which aims to promote science and mathematics in my native country, Morocco ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¦. As part of this endeavor, I organized and mentored at the <a href='https://thinkai.ma/'>ThinkAI Hackathon</a> and used to host a bi-weekly <a href='https://abenechehab.github.io/podcast/'>podcast</a> discussing the latest AI news in Moroccan dialect.

In my spare time, I enjoy sports (primarily volleyball and bouldering), traveling (30+ countries and counting), and learning new things (currently Italian ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹).
